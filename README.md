Open source pathways and examples of getting paid to contribute to projects

üëâ Let's create a space that documents all of the roles and ways in open source that folks can actually get paid to do the work. To provide good positive examples to everyone that open source foundations and industry alike can align to pay people to work full, part-time, contracted, and donate to directly contribute to open source in roles such as 
- engineeering
- ops
- infrastructure
- documentation and technical writing
- program management
- product management
- community management

## the How of Getting Paid

There are a host of existing mechanisms that open source maintainers can get paid through. For-profit companies [can and should be giving money](https://openssf.org/blog/2025/09/23/open-infrastructure-is-not-free-a-joint-statement-on-sustainable-stewardship/) to individual maintainers, whole projects, and open source foundations supporting the work.

For open source foundations to pay open source contributors who aren't fiscally hosted by their non-profit, one can use **grants, bounties, or sponsorships**. Each method provides a way to compensate folks for their work on projects that align with the mission. There's a weird myth that is pervasive and keeps being reiterated amongst open source and industry circles, that 'we can't pay maintainers directly'. 'That doesn't work. It erodes incentives'. It's not that simple, but also, this statement is almost wholly incorrect, is really people expressing feelings being intellectuallized away, and we'll write about the myth and how we better push back on it some day in depth.

There are also lots of ways that individual maintainers can set themselves up to be paid to open source. We'll cover that, too, but that's the receiving end of this process. Let's maybe make the maintainers not have even more work to do if we can help it.


### For-profit companies need to pay open source maintainers and employ open source maintainers for the work.
* **Full-time employment**: The company hires a developer, whose full-time or part-time job is to work on and maintain specific open source projects. These projects are usually critical to the company's own products or services.
* **Allocation of Engineering Time for Contributions**: The company allocates a percentage of its engineers' work week (ex: 10-20%) for contributing to open source projects. This can include writing code, fixing bugs, improving documentation, or participating in community discussions.
* **Service contract**: contract directly with the maintainers and their expertise!
* * **Donations and Sponsorships**: Now we're talking! No/less strings attached support of the open source that we all consume.
  * Open Collective
  * GitHub Sponsors
  * Patreon
  * LiberaPay
  * Ko-fi
  * Buy Me a Coffee


### An open source foundation **absolutely can** pay open source maintainers for the work.

#### üëâüèª grants
An org can establish a **grant program** to provide funding directly to individual developers or project teams. This method is effective for supporting long-term, high-impact work. The process could involve:

* **Application**: Contributors submit a proposal outlining their project goals, a timeline, and the requested funding amount. The proposal should clearly connect the work of the non-profit's mission.
* **Review**: A committee reviews the applications based on criteria like project significance, the contributor's expertise, and the project's public benefit.
* **Agreement**: A formal grant agreement is signed, specifying the deliverables and reporting requirements. This ensures the work is completed as proposed and the funds are used appropriately.
* **Payment**: Payments can be made in a lump sum or in installments tied to project milestones. This provides a stable source of income for the contributor while they work on the project.


#### üëâüèª bounties
Bounties are a great way to fund specific, well-defined tasks or bug fixes. This approach is more transactional and less about long-term support. It's especially useful for addressing critical issues or adding new features to existing projects. Here's how it would work:

* **Task Definition**: Identify a specific task on a non-profit-aligned open source project that needs to be done. Then define the scope of the work and the bounty amount.
* **Publication**: The bounty is posted on a public platform (like GitHub, a dedicated bounty platform, or your own website) for contributors to see.
* **Claiming and Completion**: A contributor claims the bounty, completes the work, and submits it for review.
* **Verification and Payment**: You or a designated technical expert review the submitted work to ensure it meets the requirements. Once verified, you release the payment to the contributor. This method is transparent and rewards specific outcomes.


#### üëâüèª sponsorships
Sponsoring open source contributors or projects is a flexible way to provide ongoing financial support. Unlike grants, which are often project-based, sponsorships can be for general support of a contributor's work.

* **Individual Sponsorships**: Directly sponsor individual developers who are key maintainers of projects that align with your mission. This provides them with a consistent income stream to continue their valuable work. Platforms like GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective make this process straightforward.
* **Project Sponsorships**: Sponsor the entire project, allowing the project's maintainers to distribute the funds as they see fit (paying for infrastructure, compensating contributors, or hosting events). This provides a more hands-off approach, empowering the project's leadership to manage the funds.

## why pay maintainers
I don't know, maybe folks should be compensated for the work they do if they want to be! But also, don't take my word for it, read these things by smarter humans:
- [Paying maintainers is good](https://jacobian.org/2024/feb/16/paying-maintainers-is-good/)
- [Who will maintain the maintainers?](https://www.runtime.news/who-will-maintain-the-maintainers-open-source-groups-push-for-a-sustainable-future/)
- [the Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/about/)
- "96% of the demand-side value [of open source software] is created by only 5% of OSS developers", [The Value of Open Source Software](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/24-038_51f8444f-502c-4139-8bf2-56eb4b65c58a.pdf)
